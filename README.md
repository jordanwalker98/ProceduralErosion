Simple algorithm for computing hydraulic and thermal erosion on infinite procedural terrain in realtime on the GPU. Extension of droplet-based algorithm described here: https://github.com/SebLague/Hydraulic-Erosion applied to a perlin noise procedural terrain to create plausible looking mountains in realtime. Change "offset" and "noise freq" in erosion script to see that terrain is "infinite".
